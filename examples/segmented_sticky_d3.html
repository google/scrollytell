                        remember to shut the pop-holes.</div>

                        kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the
                        scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.</div>

                <div>

                        strange dream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other animals.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div>It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon as Mr. Jones was safely
                        out of the way.</div>

                        Willingdon Beauty) was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose an
                        hour's sleep in order to hear what he had to say.</div>

                        bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from a beam.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div>He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but he was still a majestic-looking
                        pig, with a wise and benevolent appearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been
                        cut.</div>

                <div>

                <div>
                    <div>The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down
                        their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal concealed in the
                        straw.</div>

                        back after her fourth foal.</div>
